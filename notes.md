Inspiration

I work in a large organization with a large variety of cloud/compute platforms with different implementations where we have to deploy applications. Depending on the compute platform chosen, various governance/security teams provide gaurdrails which adds varying degrees of time, cost, and stress to this process and CI/CD work generally. This generates confusion about which cloud platforms are easier or harder to use in the new(er) self service era. This site is a way for me to try out new vendor products express an opinion about which are the easiest to use in their native form. 

How this site works
I choose one or more of the sample apps listed below and attempt to deploy them to a vendors platform. Using that experience, I provide a short editorial on how easy the product is to use and list the steps needed to deploy the sample app. 

What this site is not

an advertisement for any vendor
an evaluation of CI/CD tools available for use with a product
an evaluation of security features available for use with a product
a recommendation about which platform/product to use. 

Evaluation Criteria

a bias for containers -- support for container deployment is table stakes nowadays
how many command line steps are needed to deploy an application -- best case, I can deploy the app in one command line
transaction costs, both time and money -- 
complexity of steps/know how needed to deploy an application -- kubernetes adds complexity, but doesn't mean it will neccesarily, do i need to add a product specific configuration file,etc
a bias for command line tooling
